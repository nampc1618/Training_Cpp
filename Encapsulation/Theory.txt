Encapsulation in C++ is defined as the wrapping up of data and infomation in a single unit.
In Object-Oriented Programming, Encapsulation is defined as binding together the data and the functions that manipulate them.

Two Important property of Encapsulation:
1. Data protection
2. Infomation Hiding.

Features of Encapsulation:
1. We can not access any function from the class directly. We need an object to access that function that is using the
member variables of that class.
2. The function which we are making inside the class must use only member variables, only then it is called encapsulation.
3. If we don't make a function inside the class which is using the member variable of the class then we don't call it encapsulation.
4. Increase in the security of data.
5. It helps to control the modification of our data member.
