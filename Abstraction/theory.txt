Data abstraction is one of the most essential and important features of object-oriented programming in C++.
Abstraction means displaying only essential information and hiding the details.

Types of Abstraction:
1. Data abstraction
2. Control abstraction

- Abstraction using classes: A class can decide which data member will be visible to the outside world and which is not.

- Abstraction in Header files: 

- Abstraction using Access Specifiers: public and private.

Advantage of Data Abstraction
1. Helps the user to avoid writing the low-level code
2. Avoid code duplication and increases reusability
3. Can change the internal implementtation of the class independently without affecting the user.
4. Helps to increase the sercurity of an application or program as only important details are provided to the user.
5. It reduces the complexity as well as the redundancy of the code, therefore increasing the readability.
