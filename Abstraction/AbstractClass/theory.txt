- In C++ programming there is no built-in concept of interface
- In order to create an inteface, we need to create an abstract class which is having only pure virtual methods.
- In C++, Interface are also called pure abstract class.

Pure Virtual Function

- A Pure Virtual Function is a function where we only declare the function but not the function definition.
- The implementation for pure virtual methods is done at the derived class by methods/function overriding.

Abstract Class 

- An Abstract Class is a class that is specially designed to be used as a base class.
- Abstract Class must have at least one pure virtual function.
- It may have variables and normal functions.
- The derived classes of an abstract class must implement all the pure virtual function of their base class
or else they become abstract as well.

Interface

- Declare only pure virtual functions
- For pure virtual function assign only 0
- Cannot create an instance of the class
- We can create a pointer to the instance of the derived class with a reference of a base abstract class.
